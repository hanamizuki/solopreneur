# solopreneur

Building alone doesn't mean building without a team. This Claude Code plugin gives solo founders the workflows of a full engineering org — plan review, code review, automated PR cycles, multi-platform expertise, and even a thinking partner — in one install.

## Install

Not yet on a public marketplace. Install from GitHub:

```bash

## Skills

### Your Virtual Engineering Team

Skills listed in the order you'd use them during a typical development cycle:

| Role | Skill | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Advisor** | `/second-opinion` | Challenges your plan across 5 dimensions (completeness, consistency, clarity, scope, feasibility) using an independent reviewer |
| **Tech Lead** | `/preflight` | Reviews your technical plan against platform-specific best practices before you write a single line of code |
| **Coworker** | `/worktree-handoff` | Creates an isolated git worktree with a CONTEXT.md so the next session picks up exactly where you left off |
| **Autopilot** | `/autopilot` | Splits a large feature into multiple PRs and orchestrates unattended implementation, review, and merge |
| **Code Reviewer** | `/specialist-review` | Detects your tech stack, dispatches matching expert agents, and reviews against best-practice skill indices |
| **QA Gate** | `/greenlight` | Triggers external reviewers (Codex, Gemini, CodeRabbit), fixes issues, re-triggers — loops until the PR is clean |
| **SRE** | `/post-mortem` | Traces a bug through git history, finds the root cause commit, produces a structured post-mortem report |
| **Coach** | `/session-retro` | Reviews the current conversation for mistakes, traces root causes, proposes durable process improvements |
| **Thinking Partner** | `/perspective` | Switch between 6 thinker perspectives (Musk, Feynman, Munger, Naval, Jobs, Taleb) to analyze problems from a different angle |

### How Skills Work Together

```
Idea
 │
 ├─ /second-opinion ── Challenge the spec
 ├─ /preflight ─────── Verify the technical approach
 │
 ├─ /worktree-handoff ─ Isolate the work
 ├─ /autopilot ──────── Split into PRs, auto-implement
 │   │
 │   ├─ /specialist-review ── Expert code review per PR
 │   └─ /greenlight ────────── External review loop per PR
 │
 ├─ /post-mortem ───── Something broke? Trace the root cause
 └─ /session-retro ─── What did we learn?
```

## Agents

Platform-specific development experts used by `/preflight` and `/specialist-review`. Each agent consults a skill index of best practices for its platform.

| Agent | Platform | Skill Index Coverage |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| `ios-dev` | iOS/macOS SwiftUI | Development patterns, SwiftUI reference, iOS 26 features |
| `android-dev` | Android/Kotlin | Compose UI, Navigation, Room, Coroutines, testing |
| `web-dev` | React/frontend | React/Next.js performance optimization (Vercel guide) |
| `nextjs-dev` | Next.js/React | Same as web-dev, specialized for Next.js projects |
| `python-dev` | Python/FastAPI | LangGraph, service lifecycle, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering |
| `llm-dev` | LLM/LangGraph | Agent optimization, prompt architecture, eval tools |

## Ecosystem

This plugin integrates with tools across the Claude Code ecosystem. All integrations are optional and degrade gracefully — the plugin works with just `git` and `gh`.

### External Code Reviewers

`/greenlight` orchestrates these reviewers with automatic fallback:

| Reviewer | How it works | Setup |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| [Codex GitHub Bot](https://github.com/apps/chatgpt-codex-connector) | Triggers via `@codex review` PR comment | Enable Codex GitHub App on your repo |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Runs `codex review` locally | `npm i -g @openai/codex && codex login` |
| [Gemini Code Assist](https://github.com/apps/gemini-code-assist) | Triggers via `/gemini review` PR comment | Enable Gemini Code Assist on your repo |
| [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) | Auto-triggers on push (passive) | Enable CodeRabbit on your repo |

### MCP Servers

| Server | Used by | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| [context7](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/context7) | `/preflight`, `/specialist-review` | Fetches current official docs for APIs and frameworks |

### Claude Code Built-in Skills

`/greenlight` uses this built-in skill during internal review:

- `/simplify` — code quality, reuse, efficiency

### Skills from Other Sources

| Source | Skills used | Used by |
|--------|------------|---------|
| [superpowers](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/superpowers) (plugin) | `requesting-code-review`, `receiving-code-review` | `/greenlight`, `/specialist-review` |
| [gstack](https://github.com/gstack-dev/gstack) (user-level skill) | `/review` — SQL safety, trust boundaries, structural issues | `/greenlight` |

### Third-Party Skill Libraries

The agent skill indices reference skills from these sources. Install them for deeper platform expertise:

| Source | Platform | Skills |
|--------|----------|--------|
| [Axiom](https://github.com/CharlesWiltgen/Axiom) | iOS/macOS | 100+ skills covering SwiftUI, SwiftData, concurrency, networking, testing, App Store, camera, system integration, AI, graphics |
| User-level skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) | All | Your own project-specific patterns and conventions |

### CLI Tools

| Tool | Required? | Used by |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `git` | Required | All skills |
| `gh` (GitHub CLI) | Required | `/greenlight`, `/autopilot`, `/post-mortem` |
| `jq` | Required | `/greenlight` |
| `codex` (Codex CLI) | Optional | `/greenlight`, `/second-opinion` |
