# Vendored Skill

This skill is vendored from a third-party source. **Do not edit in place** —
edits will be overwritten on the next `scripts/sync-vendored.sh` run.

- **Source repo**: https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable
- **Source path**: `.claude/skills/impeccable`
- **Pinned commit**: 32930818a109fafa87199babe92fa8e530cff5d3

**Not a byte-for-byte mirror.** The sync mechanically rewrites the copied
files so they work as part of a plugin: the frontmatter `name:` is
normalized to the folder name; bundled-script paths are rewritten to
`"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/"`; argument tokens (`$0`-`$9`) in a
`SKILL.md` that takes no arguments are escaped as `\$0`-`\$9`, so
Claude Code does not substitute them into the body at load time; and
`disable-model-invocation` is injected when the manifest asks for it. See
`scripts/sync-vendored.sh` for the exact transformations and the reasons.

To update: edit `vendor/manifest.json` if needed, then re-run this
plugin's `./scripts/sync-vendored.sh`.
